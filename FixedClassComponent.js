The issue stems from the inherent differences in how state is managed between class and functional components. Functional components leverage hooks for state management, while class components use `this.setState`.  Directly using a hook's update function (e.g., from `useState`) within a class method bypasses the intended state update mechanism of the class component.  To solve this, refactor your class component to utilize the `this.setState` method for updating state, ensuring proper rendering updates.  Alternatively, consider converting the class component to a functional component to leverage the benefits of the `use` syntax and hooks.
