This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in React 19 when using the new `use` syntax with class components.  The `BuggyClassComponent.js` file shows the problematic code, where attempting to directly utilize a state update function within a class method leads to unexpected behavior. The `FixedClassComponent.js` file provides a corrected approach, illustrating how to properly handle state updates in this scenario.  This bug highlights the incompatibility between the functional component-oriented `use` syntax and the traditional state management of class components.
